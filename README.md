This is a C++ program that I made, using the Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, that uses five individual servo motors to individually move finger depending on different hex values received via an external BLE program
The hex code to servo goes as follows

Servo 1: 0 (original position) and 1 (180 degrees) = Pinky

Servo 2: 2 (original position) and 3 (180 degrees) = Ring

Servo 3: 4 (original position) and 5 (180 degrees) = Middle

Servo 4: 6 (original position) and 7 (180 degrees) = Index

Servo 5: 8 (original position) and 9 (180 degrees) = Thumb

The servo numbers correspond to the digital output they are assigned to, Servo # - 1 = pinout.
The BLE software that I used is BlueLight on the iPhone 11 IOS 18.1.
For the contractile motion, I used braided fishing line and for the extension, I used 1/16 in shock cord (might move to springs)
The joints of the fingers use a set of 3mm nuts, bolts, and washers to aid in smoother movement.

For the physical hand, I took heavy inspiration from GaÃ«l Langevin on InMoov for most of the physical attributes of the hand and have linked his site below.
